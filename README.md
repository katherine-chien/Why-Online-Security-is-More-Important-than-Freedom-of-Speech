# Why-Online-Security-is-More-Important-than-Freedom-of-Speech


Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in modern society, ensuring individuals the ability to express their own opinions in the public domain. It is crucial for promoting democracy and encouraging diverse viewpoints. However, with the growth of the internet, the online space has become a key platform for communication and information sharing. The conflict between freedom of speech and online security has become increasingly apparent. In certain situations, to ensure public safety and maintain order in the online space, we need to impose appropriate restrictions on freedom of speech. Therefore, freedom of speech is not more important than online security, and in safeguarding social stability and preventing harm, online security should take priority.

Firstly, we need to recognize that while freedom of speech is a basic individual right, it is reasonable and necessary to impose certain limitations when it involves public safety and crime prevention. When speech incites violence, hatred, or spreads misleading information, it may directly threaten the safety of individuals and society. For example, hate speech can intensify societal tensions and may even lead to actual violent events. Similarly, fake news and misleading information, especially during public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause the public to make incorrect judgments, endangering lives. In such cases, freedom of speech should be restricted to protect broader public interests.

Secondly, certain types of online content should be monitored and regulated to ensure internet security. This includes content related to terrorism, child exploitation, and online fraud. Terrorist organizations often use the internet for propaganda and recruitment, which can easily lead to the spread of extremist ideologies and social instability. Child pornography and exploitation pose serious threats to vulnerable groups, and should be strictly combated and censored. Additionally, online scams and financial fraud should also be regulated, as these behaviors can cause severe damage to individuals' property and privacy. In these instances, unrestricted freedom of speech can directly harm others' interests and should be controlled.

When it comes to responsibility for online content regulation, it should be a shared decision involving companies, governments, users, and technology. Internet platforms, as publishers of content, should take responsibility for supervision, establishing internal review policies based on their terms of service. Governments should develop basic legal frameworks guiding how companies regulate content when public and national security are involved, but they should not entirely control the review process to avoid infringing on individuals' rights to expression. At the same time, user communities should participate in the development of content rules, making them more transparent and aligned with public interest. Finally, on large platforms, a combination of human reviewers and AI technology can more effectively manage vast amounts of content, preventing the spread of harmful information.

Real-world examples support this viewpoint. During the 2020 U.S. presidential election, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter flagged and removed large amounts of misinformation and misleading content. Such misinformation could influence voters’ decisions, threatening the fairness of the election. The spread of this information not only affects public opinion but can also lead to social unrest, making platform intervention a necessary measure for maintaining online security. Similarly, in the 2019 Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, the shooter livestreamed the terrorist attack online, sparking a global discussion on regulating violent online content. New Zealand and other countries subsequently adopted stricter measures for managing online content to prevent the further spread of such violent propaganda.

Another example is the European Union’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which regulates how companies handle user data and emphasizes protecting personal privacy rights while preventing data misuse. These regulations safeguard individual online security while also limiting the freedom companies have in processing data, illustrating that in some cases, it is reasonable to restrict certain behaviors and speech for the public good.

In conclusion, while freedom of speech is an important right, online security should be prioritized in protecting public safety, individual privacy, and preventing harmful behaviors. Appropriate restrictions can not only protect society from the dangers of extreme speech and criminal activities but also ensure the stable and orderly development of the online space. Therefore, in the internet age, freedom of speech is not more important than online security, and a balance between the two must be achieved.
